  <h4>Binding Free Energy Calculations of HIV Protein Enzymes</h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> HIV AIDS is a deadly disease that
    currently affects the life of millions of people infected
    worldwide. Using high performance computing clusters (XSEDE
    resources) and distributed computing networks (Temple Grid and IBM
    World Community Grid), I was a leading member in performing binding
    free energy calculations to discover potent inhibitors against
    three major protein enzymes which play important roles in the life
    cycle of HIV viruses: HIV-1 protease(PR), integrase (IN), and
    reverse transcriptase (RT). Please check our related project,
