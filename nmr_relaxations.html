  <h4>NMR Relaxation Theories and Calculations for Dynamical Biomolecules</h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> Many macromolecules (such as
    carbohydrates, small RNAs, unfolded or partially-folded proteins,
    multidomain proteins, and intrinsically disordered systems) might
    be quite flexible, therefore NMR observables do not always
    correlate with a single conformer but instead with an ensemble of
    low free energy conformers that can be accessed by thermal
    fluctuations. Some of my projects at Rugters University include
    developing NMR relaxation theories and interpreting experimental
    NMR quantities (such as R1/R2/NOE, RDC and J couplings) in terms
    of conformational ensemble and multiscale dynamics of
    biomolecules.
