  <article>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> I am research software engineer
      at Princeton University.  I have both roles of research
      decorvery and software development for most of my projects, from
      early physical systems in the context of condensed matter and
      statistical physics to recent biological macromolecules for
      health problems. My long-term interests in developing algorithms
      and software to perform state-of-art computing in structural
      biology, computational biophysics and chemistry, statistical and
      condensed matter physics are listed as but not limited to:
      computational CryoEM, NMR calculations, accelerated sampling
      methods in high-dimensional space, force field developments,
      implicit and explicit solvation models, and free energy
      calculations using homogeneous high performance clusters or
      heterogeneous distributed systems.
