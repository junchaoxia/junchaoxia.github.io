  <article>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> I am a research software engineer
      at Princeton University.  I have both roles of research
      discovery and software development for most of my projects, from
      early simulations of liquid materials and earthquake models
      in the context of condensed matter and statistical physics, to
      recent simulations of protein enzymes and protein-ligand complexes
      related to drug design. I have long-term interests
      in developing algorithms and software in structural
      biology, computational biophysics and chemistry, statistical and
      condensed matter physics, with the focuses listed as but not limited to:
      computational Cryo-EM, NMR calculations, accelerated sampling
      methods in high-dimensional space, force fields and solvation models,
      as well as binding free energy calculations using homogeneous HPC clusters
      and heterogeneous distributed systems.
