  <h4>Structural Ensemble and Slow Dynamics of Multidomain Protein
    Enzymes and Signaling Proteins</h4>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> Structural flexibility and slow
	dynamics of multidomain proteins play many roles in biological
	phenomena such as enzymatic functions and interaction networks
	responsible for cell signalling. Characterizing the
	interdomain motions of these proteins in wild-type and mutation
	is crucial to understand those mechanisms and develop
	corresponding control methods for diseases. For these application studies,
      I used various advanced sampling methods such as
      map-restrained Langevin dynamics, Markov state modeling and metadynamics.
