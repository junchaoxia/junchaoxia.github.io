  <h4>Simulation of Earthquake Models</h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Earthquake fault systems belong to a wide class of nonlinear
    driven dissipative systems in nature which need much work to
    understand although physicists have developed a well-defined
    theoretical framework to describe systems in equilibrium. For my
    Ph.D. work at Clark University and Boston University, I built
    earthquake models and performed earthquake simulations to
    understand the power-law scaling for earthquake phenomena using
    the spinodal nucleation theory from statistical physics.
