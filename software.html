  <h4> <a href="http://spr.math.princeton.edu/">
       ASPIRE (Algorithms for Single Particle Reconstruction)</a></h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> The original ASPIRE package was
    developed in to prototype new ideas on algorithms for single particle
    reconstruction. It consists of more than 100,000 lines of Matlab
    code and includes many advanced algorithms in different aspects of
    CryoEM 3D map reconstruction such as fully automatic particle
    picking, denoising and classification of 2D images, 3D orientation
    estimation at large noise, covariance 3D analysis for structure variability
    and molecular heterogeneity. I am the main developer
    of <a href="https://github.com/ComputationalCryoEM/ASPIRE-Python">
    the new ASPIRE Python package</a> targeting a reusable and
    sustainable package for internal and external users and
    developers.

  <h4>Academic IMPACT Molecular Simulation Program</h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> IMPACT is a molecular mechanics and
    molecular dynamics simulation engine developed starting in the
    1980's in Ron Levy's group at Rutgers University. Joint
    development with <a href="https://www.schrodinger.com/">Schrodinger
      Inc.</a> started in 2000 and it is one of
    basic components for many other products for structure-based drug
    discovery. I was the key developer of academic version of IMPACT
    in Ron Levy group at Temple University, with three major goals:
    1) including more advanced sampling methods; 2) enabling GPU
    computing with openMM library; 3) porting IMPACT as a MD engine
    onto IBM World Community Grid for distributed computing
    environments.

  <h4>  <a href="https://github.com/ComputationalBiophysicsCollaborative/AsyncRE">
      Asynchronous Replica Exchange (AsyncRE) Framework</a></h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> Traditional synchronous replica
    exchange methods prefer stable, tightly coupled, and homogeneous
    computing architectures due to the centralized synchronization
    steps for exchanging thermodynamic states after a MD period. In
    contrast, the AsyncRE framework we developed at Temple University
    removes the synchronizing concept and was designed to facilitate
    large-scale or massive-scale REMD simulations on distributed grid
    computing environments such as heterogeneous high performance
    clusters, local campus grids, and
    <a href="https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/research/fahb/overview.do">
    massive IBM World Community Grid</a>.
  </p>      

  <h4> <a href="https://github.com/ComputationalBiophysicsCollaborative/bedam_workflow">
      BEDAM for Estimating Absolute Binding Free Energy</a></h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Binding Energy Distribution
    Analysis Method (BEDAM) estimates absolute binding free energies
    for protein-ligand systems, based on a statistical mechanics
    theory of molecular association, parallel Hamiltonian replica
    exchange method, AGBNP implicit solvation model, and reweighting
    technique of multi-state statistical inference. I was the major
    developer for more advanced BEDAM methods using biasing potentials and AsyncRE
    framework, and Python workflows to prepare, submit, and post-analyze
    massive BEDAM simulations using the commercial and academic IMPACT.
  </p>
  
  <h4> Other Software Packages</h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> I also developed in-house
    software packages for my postdoc and graduate projects such as
    NMR calculations, structure ensemble predictions of complex carbohydrates,
    simulations of earthquake models, and simulations of liquid materials.
