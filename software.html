  <h4> <a href="http://spr.math.princeton.edu/">
       ASPIRE (Algorithms for Single Particle Reconstruction)</a></h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> The original ASPIRE package was
    developed in Professor Amit Singer's group at Princeton University
    to prototype new ideas on algorithms for single particle
    reconstruction. It consists of more than 100,000 lines of Matlab
    code and includes many algorithm advances in different aspects of
    CryoEM 3D map reconstruction such as fully automatic particle
    picking, rigorous mathematics and algorithms for 2D image
    representation and 3D orientation estimation, accurate 2D
    classification for images and 3D classification for density maps,
    and distinct structure variability analysis. I am the main
    developer
    of <a href="https://github.com/ComputationalCryoEM/ASPIRE-Python">
    the new ASPIRE Python package</a> targeting a reusable and
    sustainable package for internal and external users and
    developers.

  <h4>Academic IMPACT Molecular Simulation Program</h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> IMPACT is a molecular mechanics and
    molecular dynamics simulation engine developed starting in the
    1980's in Ron Levy's group at Rutgers University. Joint
    development with <a href="https://www.schrodinger.com/">Schrodinger
      Inc.</a> started in 2000 and it is one of
    basic components for many other products for structure-based drug
    discovery. I was the key developer of academic version of IMPACT
    in Ron Levy group at Temple University, with three major goals:
    1) including more advanced sampling methods; 2) enabling GPU
    computing with openMM library; 3) porting IMPACT as a MD engine
    onto IBM World Community Grid for distributed computing
    environments.

  <h4>  <a href="https://github.com/ComputationalBiophysicsCollaborative/AsyncRE">
      Asynchronous Replica Exchange (AsyncRE) Framework</a></h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> Traditional synchronous replica
    exchange methods prefer stable, tightly coupled, and homogeneous
    computing architectures due to the centralized synchronization
    steps for exchanging thermodynamic states after a MD period. In
    contrast, the AsyncRE framework we developed at Temple University
    removes the synchronizing concept and was designed to facilitate
    large-scale or massive-scale REMD simulations on distributed grid
    computing environments such as heterogeneous high performance
    clusters, local campus grids, and
    <a href="https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/research/fahb/overview.do">
    massive IBM World Community Grid</a>.

  <h4> <a href="https://github.com/ComputationalBiophysicsCollaborative/bedam_workflow">
      BEDAM for Estimating Absolute Binding Free Energy</a></h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Binding Energy Distribution
    Analysis Method (BEDAM) estimates absolute binding free energies
    for protein-ligand systems, based on a statistical mechanics
    theory of molecular association, parallel Hamiltonian replica
    exchange method, AGBNP implicit solvation model, and reweighting
    technique of multi-state statistical inference. I was the major
    developer for more advanced BEDAM methods and implementations of
    Python workflows using both the commercial and academic IMPACT.
  </p>
  
  <h4> Other Simulation Packages</h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> I also developed other in-house
    simulation packages for my Ph.D. and M.S. projects such as
    simulations of earthquakes and simulations of liquid materials.
