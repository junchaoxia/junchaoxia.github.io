  <h4>Advanced Sampling for Biomolecular Simulations</h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> Biological molecules exhibit
    complex dynamics on timescales varying from subnano to
    milliseconds and beyond, due to free energy barriers of different
    heights. Traditional MD simulations have difficulty on studying
    these complicated behaviors on timescales longer than milliseconds
    even using large-scale high performance computing resources or
    highly specified expensive computer chips. Advanced sampling
    algorithms are the alternative methods. To overcome this timescale
    challenge on protein-ligand binding and slow conformational
    dynamics, some of my major work at Temple University included developing
    large-scale multidimensional asynchronous replica exchange (AsyncER)
    algorithm, combining AsyncRE with biasing potentials for rescaling
    inter and intra-interactions of ligand/receptor,
    and improve corresponding reweighting techniques for massive simulations.
    In addition to REMD methods for binding free energy calculations,
    I also used various advanced sampling methods such as
    map-restrained langevin dynamics, Markov state modeling, metadynamics
    and adaptively biased molecular dynamics for exploring free energy
    landscapes of conformational changes.
